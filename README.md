Vue Material Kit 2 is our newest free VueJS Design System. Its amazing design is inspired by Material Design and contains all the components you need for your development. If you’re a developer looking to create good-looking websites, rich with features, and highly customisable, here is your match.

**Fully Coded Elements**

Vue Material Kit 2 is built with over 70 frontend individual elements, like buttons, inputs, navbars, alerts or cards, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in color, which you can easily modify using sass files. You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code because all elements are implemented.

This free VueJS 3 & Bootstrap 5 template is coming with pre-built design blocks, so the development process is seamless,
switching from our pages to the real website is very easy to be done.

**Documentation built by Developers**

Each element is well presented in very complex documentation.
You can read more about the [documentation here](https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/vue/overview/material-kit/).

**Example Pages**

If you want to get inspiration or just show something directly to your clients, you can jump-start your development with our pre-built example pages. You will be able to quickly set up the basic structure for your web project.
